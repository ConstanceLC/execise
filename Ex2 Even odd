#Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. Hint: how does an even / odd number react differently when divided by 2?

#Extras:

#    If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
#    Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.

# check even or odd or mutiple of 4
n = int(input("Please enter a number[q to quit] : "))

if n % 2 == 0:
    print("This is a even number")

if n % 4 == 0:
    print('This is a multiple of 4')

if n % 2 != 0:
    print("this is an odd number")

#check whether divides evenly
n1 = int(input("Please enter the second number : "))
if n%n1 ==0:
  print('They can divide evenly')
else:
  print('They cannot divide evenly')

print('Answer: '+str(n//n1)+' left '+str(n%n1))
