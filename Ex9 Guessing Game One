#Generate a random number between 1 and 9 (including 1 and 9).
# Ask the user to guess the number, then tell them whether they guessed too low, too high, or exactly right.
# (Hint: remember to use the user input lessons from the very first exercise)

#Extras:

# NOT FINISHED ####   Keep the game going until the user types “exit”
#    Keep track of how many guesses the user has taken, and when the game ends, print this out.

    elif p1 < n :
        print('A bit higher...')
    elif p1 == n:
